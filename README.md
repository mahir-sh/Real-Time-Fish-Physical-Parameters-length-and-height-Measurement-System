# Real-Time-Fish-Physical-Parameters-length-and-height-Measurement-System
Final Year Capstone Project 



 
 In aquaculture, farmer has to ensure the size, height, width properly to trade fish. For this,
 they use fish measuring board to measure height and width. But is was impossible to find out
 the height and width of all of the fishes in the fish tank. Only 5-10 fishes were taken randomly
 to make an assumption on the height and width of all other fish. The size of all fishes are not
 same in a fish tank. There can be difference in fish size in a same fish pond. Fish size plays an
 important role in providing fish food. Fish can die from over feeding. Size of all fish in a fish
 tank should be gathered to maintain the proper health of the fish. It is utterly impossible to
 observe all fish length manually. Our real time fish length detection system will eradicate all
 of the above problem and provide accurate data of fish length

I last tested/updated this code using OpenCV 4.4.0 and Python 3.8 on Linux on March 11, 2022. All good.
IMPORTANT: If you are using a different version of OpenCV. The output from cv2.findContours may have changed. Go to targeting_tools.py lines 325-237 (the line the error will say) and change frame3,contours,hierarchy to contours,hierarchy (or the other way around).
